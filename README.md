# smart-study-lamp
The **Smart Study Lamp** uses an **ultrasonic sensor** and **Arduino** to automatically turn the lamp on/off based on user proximity. If a user is within 100 cm, the lamp lights up; otherwise, it turns off. This project offers energy efficiency, hands-free operation, and easy customization for further features.
